Patrick Semansky/APRev. Robert Fisher of St. John’s Church in downtown Washington, DC, said he was unaware that President Trump would be stopping by the church on Monday evening.“I had no idea what was going to be going on at 7 p.m. tonight. I actually haven't seen any of it. I've been listening to it all, of course, and honestly, it feels like so many ways a surreal moment for me. So yeah, I feel like I'm in some alternative universe in some way,” Fisher said in an interview on Fox News.Fisher said the fire that broke out in his church on Sunday evening damaged one room in the basement of the church, and affected neither of the two historic buildings on the church’s property.“I went by it later in the night, actually in the wee hours of the morning and actually had a chance to inspect and look around myself, my wife and I. That was actually very positive moment because just personally. I was thrilled to see that the fire only burnt the nursery and the fire didn't expand out,” Fisher said.Fisher praised the peaceful protesters, saying they need to \"stay on this message of fighting racism.\"“That is the only way that we are going to have healing and we’re going to really progress,\" he added.He also made what some might consider a veiled criticism of Trump, who lives just across Lafayette park at the White House.“We hope that St. John's, it’s not just a historic church, it truly is, it is a remarkably historic church, but we seek to be a space for grace in the city,” Fisher said. “I find that the particular neighborhood that we are in is not always a place where you find grace.”"}
