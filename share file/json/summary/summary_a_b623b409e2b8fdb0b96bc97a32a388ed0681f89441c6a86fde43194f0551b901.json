Candlelit vigils have been held in Hong Kong's Victoria Park every year since 1990, and recent events have attracted tens of thousands of participants.Police would not give permission for this year's rally to go ahead, however, citing coronavirus restrictions on gatherings of more than eight people, according to an official letter shared with CNN.Read More"}
