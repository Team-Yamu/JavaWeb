{"summary": "(CNN) A serious divide has emerged among Donald Trump's top allies and advisers over how the President should address several nights of protests and riots across the nation following the death of George Floyd.\nTrump has adopted an uneven message on the demonstrations.\nSeveral advisers feared, and hoped to avoid, another Charlottesville moment, when Trump was criticized after declaring in 2017 that \"very fine people\" were among the Nazi mobs that descended upon Charlottesville, Virginia.\nWhen the President made his first vague statement on that violence, he blamed the conflicts on \"many sides.\"\nBut he later tried to downplay his message about using armed force on looters as a statement rather than a threat."}
